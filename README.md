**Car Sales**
[Car Sales Analysis](https://github.com/Jusecace/SQL-portfolio/blob/main/Car%20sales) I used a dataset from [Kaggle's "Car Sales Report"](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/missionjee/car-sales-report) and loaded it into MySQL for analysis. I queried the dataset to find the highest car sales and revenue by month. Additionally, I compared gender preferences in transmission type and created a table showcasing top dealerships. Furthermore, I organized data by car models to identify leading companies, models, and specifications.
